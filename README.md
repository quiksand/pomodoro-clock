# pomodoro-clock

##About
More correctly a timer, of the kitchen variety.

It was created to satisfy the requirements of the third Free Code Camp Zipline.

##Working principles
Set the timer and watch the circle fill up with the countdown.

##Known issues
1. Running processes in other tabs can cause the page to lag, and the time will be incorrect. This usually manifests itself by the timer jumping one or more seconds. That's the timer self-correcting after a lag.

##Disclaimer
Don't use it for rocket science or brain surgery- it wasn't designed to handle that kind of responsibility ;)
